## Extended Tips for Setting Key Results with OKRs

### 1. In Domain
- **When to Take Care of This**: When aligning KRs with the overarching objective and team's domain.
- **Why This Tip**: Ensures that KRs are relevant to both the objective and the team’s expertise or function.
- **Bad Example**: For an objective focused on improving customer service, a KR related to product development.
- **Good Example**: For the objective "Establish clear value to restaurant suppliers," KRs like "Reorders at 85%" and "Revenue of $250K".

### 2. Actionable
- **When to Take Care of This**: When identifying how actions taken by the team can directly impact the KRs.
- **Why This Tip**: Actionable KRs ensure that the team's efforts have a clear and direct impact on achieving the goals.
- **Bad Example**: "Increase brand awareness" without specifying how it will be achieved.
- **Good Example**: "Increase referral rates by 25%" as a result of specific customer engagement strategies.

### 3. Accessible
- **When to Take Care of This**: When designing KRs so that they are understandable and can be monitored by all relevant team members.
- **Why This Tip**: Accessibility ensures that all team members can engage with and understand the progress towards KRs.
- **Bad Example**: Highly technical KRs that are only understandable by a specific department.
- **Good Example**: "Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) greater than 7" - a metric understandable across departments.

### 4. Auditable
- **When to Take Care of This**: When setting up measurement systems for KRs.
- **Why This Tip**: Ensures that KRs are based on clear, unambiguous data that can be consistently and accurately measured.
- **Bad Example**: KRs based on subjective judgments or unclear metrics.
- **Good Example**: "Increase revenue to $500K per month," which is a clear and measurable financial target.

### 5. Measurable
- **When to Take Care of This**: When establishing KRs that quantifiably reflect progress.
- **Why This Tip**: Measurable KRs allow for clear tracking of progress and achievement of the objective.
- **Bad Example**: "Improve team collaboration" without measurable indicators.
- **Good Example**: "Reduce customer service call duration by 15%".

### 6. Results Oriented
- **When to Take Care of This**: When defining KRs to reflect outcomes rather than just tasks.
- **Why This Tip**: Focuses on the impact of actions on behavior and results, rather than just completing activities.
- **Bad Example**: "Conduct 10 customer interviews."
- **Good Example**: "Increase customer satisfaction scores by 20% following improved service strategies".

### 7. Balanced
- **When to Take Care of This**: When ensuring KRs cover different aspects of the objective.
- **Why This Tip**: Balanced KRs provide a holistic view of progress and prevent overemphasis on a single aspect.
- **Bad Example**: Focusing only on revenue growth without considering customer satisfaction.
- **Good Example**: Balancing revenue growth with customer satisfaction and employee engagement metrics.

### 8. Simple
- **When to Take Care of This**: When communicating KRs to the team.
- **Why This Tip**: Simple KRs are easily understood and remembered by everyone involved.
- **Bad Example**: Complex KRs involving multiple variables and conditions.
- **Good Example**: "Achieve 15% growth in active users".

### 9. Realistic
- **When to Take Care of This**: When setting expectations for what can be achieved.
- **Why This Tip**: Realistic KRs ensure that targets are attainable and do not demotivate the team.
- **Bad Example**: Setting a KR to double the revenue in an unrealistic timeframe.
- **Good Example**: "Increase customer retention rate by 10% in Q2".

### 10. Ambitious
- **When to Take Care of This**: When challenging the team to strive for significant improvement.
- **Why This Tip**: Ambitious KRs push the team to go beyond their comfort zone and achieve great results.
- **Bad Example**: Setting easily achievable KRs that don’t stimulate growth or improvement.
- **Good Example**: "Expand market share by entering two new international markets this quarter".

### 11. Trackable
- **When to Take Care of This**: When you want to monitor progress regularly.
- **Why This Tip**: Trackable KRs allow for ongoing assessment of whether the team is moving closer to achieving the objective. This continuous monitoring helps in adjusting strategies and efforts as needed.
- **Bad Example:** A KR that is assessed only at the end of a quarter or year, leaving no room for mid-course corrections.
- **Good Example:** "Weekly increase of 5% in new user sign-ups," allowing for regular tracking and response to trends.
